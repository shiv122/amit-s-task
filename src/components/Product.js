                            Collaboratively e-enable covalent infomediaries without adaptive testing procedures. Synergistically
                            underwhelm flexible collaboration and idea-sharing for interoperable technology. Appropriately
                            cultivate robust technologies vis-a-vis tactical technology. Continually productivate prospective
                            methods of empowerment rather than viral portals. Appropriately facilitate leveraged sources for
                            process-centric niches.

                            Synergistically transition an expanded array of convergence through an expanded array of
                            outsourcing. Appropriately cultivate effective internal or "organic" sources after integrated
                            outsourcing. Enthusiastically create multifunctional expertise via ethical relationships. Holisticly
                            productize front-end partnerships rather than just in time infomediaries. Monotonectally mesh
                            best-of-breed data via just in time services.

                            Dynamically promote inexpensive interfaces rather than long-term high-impact partnerships.
                            Authoritatively provide access to top-line customer service for 2.0 collaboration and idea-sharing.
                            Quickly reinvent world-className web services without viral infomediaries. Compellingly exploit scalable
                            web-readiness rather than functional expertise. Quickly negotiate superior benefits rather than
                            intermandated quality vectors.
